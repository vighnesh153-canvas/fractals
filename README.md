  Fractals
</h1>
<p align="center">
  Fractals are shapes that have fractional dimensions and they repeat themselves in each of their fragments. 
  If you zoom in or zoom out on their fragments, you find the same shape. I attempt to animate some fractals 
  and you can have a look at them by visiting <a href="https://vighnesh153-canvas.github.io/fractals/">here</a>.
  I hope you like my work, leave a star if you do.
